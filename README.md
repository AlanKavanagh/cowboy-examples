Quickstart
===============================================================================
* Go into the cowboy directory and run "make" to build Cowboy.  This is 
  dependent on three things: *make*, *rebar* and *git*

Notes
===============================================================================
Many of these examples will have vast amounts of duplication in them, this is 
because each one is designed to be viewed and runnable in a bubble with the only
external dependency being cowboy.

What is this?
===============================================================================
This is a simple project to show many examples of using the Erlang Cowboy 
"Small, fast, modular HTTP server and socket acceptor pool".  The first
order of business was to port all the amazing misultin examples over to 
cowboy.  Part of my motivation for doing this was the misultin end of 
life.
